# week1-jsReviewLab2
The objective this lesson is to learn to use JavaScript functions, conditionals, and booleans by building a fortune-telling program based on a user's name and age.

## About the project
This project is a simple fortune-telling app built with JavaScript.

## Files
- index.html  
- readme.md  
- script.js

## How it works
It uses if statements, variables and string concatenation to generate a fortune based on the user's name and age that are input. Based on the Name and Age that are input by the user, a person's fortune is told. 

This project includes 2 verions
-Prompt based - this is commented out but can be seen in the js file. 
-Bonus version - added a basic web page with inputs and a button so users can interact directly within the browser. 

### Name-based fortune possibilities
-Longer than 7 letters → “will travel the world and collect many stories.”
-Shorter than 5 letters → “will stumble upon unexpected treasure soon.”
-Between 5 and 7 letters → “will cross paths with a mysterious stranger.”


### Age-based fortunes 
-Under 18 → “will master a skill that surprises everyone.”
-18–25 → “will find joy in an unexpected friendship.”
-26–40 → “will make a bold decision that changes their path.”
-41–60 → “will inspire others with wisdom and humor.”
-Over 60 → “will enjoy laughter and peace in abundance.”

## What I Learned
- I learned about how to set prompts to collect information. 
- I learned how to change a prompt so it converts input into a number so it works with the rules on the page. 
- For the bonus, I learned how to set up the page to be a form to collect the information required and to show the results of the data selections based on variables set within the js. 
- I learned how to weave together the 2 result lines so they read like a proper sentence.
