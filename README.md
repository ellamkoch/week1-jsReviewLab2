## How it works
Based on Name and Age, a person's fortune is told. 

### Name-based fortune possibilities
-Longer than 7 letters → “will travel the world and collect many stories.”
-Shorter than 5 letters → “will stumble upon unexpected treasure soon.”
-Between 5 and 7 letters → “will cross paths with a mysterious stranger.”
-Starts with ‘E’ → “will always land on their feet, like a cat.”
-Contains an ‘u’ → “will discover a hidden talent.”

### Age-based fortunes 
-Under 18 → “will master a skill that surprises everyone.”
-18–25 → “will find joy in an unexpected friendship.”
-26–40 → “will make a bold decision that changes their path.”
-41–60 → “will inspire others with wisdom and humor.”
-Over 60 → “will enjoy laughter and peace in abundance.”
